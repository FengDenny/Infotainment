We meet them on their home turf, namely on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram, in a thorough and far-reaching film, which lends a voice to both the youths and a selection of prominent experts and industry insiders. How do social media influence society and our self-perception and mental health? Big questions that are actually answered - also by the young - from all angles in a democratic film which will make you want to re-evaluate your screen habits. Whether you are Gen X or (gasp!) a Boomer, here is a chance to polish your knowledge about our brave new world.",

They observe a world which magecraft couldn't observe and science couldn't measure all to prevent the certain extinction of humanity.  But one day, the future that Chaldea continued to observe disappears and humanity's extinction in 2017 becomes clear. Rather, it had already happened.  The cause seems to be related to Fuyuki, a provincial town in Japan, in the year 2004 CE. There, an \"unobservable region\" that had not existed before appears.  Based on the assumption that Fuyuki is the reason for humanity's extinction, Chaldea issues an order to explore, investigate, and possibly destroy this singularity – a quest for the Holy Grail, the Grand Order.",
